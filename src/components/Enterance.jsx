              The year is 2084, global warming has reached its peak and <br />
              only a few pandas are left in the World - Lucky Pandas. These
              <br /> endangered pandas, whose habitats are getting narrower and{" "}
              <br /> having difficulty finding food, embark on a journey to
              survive. <br /> During this journey, they must find new habitats
              rich in bamboo, <br /> water, and the other vital necessities they
              need on different <br /> continents. Nevertheless, it is not
              certain how they will survive <br /> on which continent. <br />{" "}
              How they progress is entirely up to you and our project.
              <br />
              <br />
              Lucky Pandas contains a unique collection of 999 NFTs that <br />{" "}
              exist on the Algorand blockchain. It is the best blockchain for{" "}
              <br /> Pandas thanks to its environmentally friendly approach.
              <br />
              <br />
              Which species they will encounter on which continents, and <br />{" "}
              how they will evolve undergo depend on the course of the <br />
              project. How the adventure will turn out is a complete mystery.
              <br />
